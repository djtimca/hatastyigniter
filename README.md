This integration will provide binary sensors for each location which is enabled on the TastyIgniter platform to provide alerts when there are orders sitting in Received status.

## Install

Copy all files under custom_components into your custom_components folder. Restart Home Assistant.

Go to Configuration->Integrations and click to add a new integration. Search for TastyIgniter and you will see the integration available.

Click add, confirm you want to install, and voila... you have the SpaceX Sensors in your Home Assistant.

Enjoy!
